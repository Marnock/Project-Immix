# Project-Immix
Senior Capstone Project

Project Immix is a multiplayer game in development. As such, in order to fully test this MVP, the unity project must be launched from the 
'Launcher' scene that is located inside the 'Scenes' folder inside of 'My Stuff'. Additionally, either multiple people must run it to show 
the working multiplayer, OR two instances of the client must run on a single windows computer to see the working connection.
